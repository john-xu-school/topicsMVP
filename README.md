## How to Setup
Install the free-liscense version of Unity 2022.3.3.31f1, Unity Hub, Visual Studio (not VS Code, they're different). You might also want to use the school-provided Photoshop application if you want to help me design assets. Open the project in from Unity Hub using the Unity editor and manipulate the two scenes. Start coding by opening up .cs scripts in Visual Studio. Good luck!
